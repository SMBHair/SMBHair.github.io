            so a couple things: <br>
            1. I can make sections here pretty easily if that might be better <br>
            2. I dont plan on keeping the hover effect; that's just to see where the end of each panel is.
            we can totally give each person a different background color or something tho. <br>
            3. jalal's 2 pfp thing shouldn't be too hard with css keyframes if we're doing that. 
            I still dont completely get it though lmao like if its on a timer or on hover or whatever

                Jim Bagel has contributed significantly to the UMASO team.
                He definitely did stuff, and that stuff really was done. His work really
                really inspired things. Jim was definitely one of the members of UMASO.

            this would look pretty much the same as the team section 
            (unless we want to something different- which honestly I would prefer cuz I dont want to store a ridiculous amount of images lmao)
            <br>
            I'm gonna start off by hiding this when the website first launches though regardless
